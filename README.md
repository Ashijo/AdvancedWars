# AdvancedWars
AdvanceWars-like game, made in a week with unity

This game have been made to improve my abiliti to make correct architecture and implement design pattern. It is my second unity-project and fourth C# one. The game himself isn't really impressive, but I like it, my first Timer manager works pretty well, and the implementation of Singletons, Pool and Factory learned me a lot.

The windows launcher is already made, but if you whant launch it on Linux, you'll have to build it yourself.
